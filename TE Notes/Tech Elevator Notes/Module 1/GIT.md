4 States of Files:
1. Untracked - GIT can see, but doesn't care
2. Modified - Changed but not saved
3. Staged - Changed and saved
4. Committed - Saved to a git repo

■ -> All GIT commands start with `git`

`git status` -> Check status of files vs Main Hub
`git add -A` -> Add ALL files to staged
`git commit` -> Save files
`git commit -m` -> Save files with comments

■ -> Commit early, commit often.

`git push "name of repository""name of branch"` -> Send to GIT repo
